# Non Goals

The following are not within the scope of this project:

**Turning neko into a service that serves multiple rooms and browsers/desktops.**
* If you need software for managing multiple rooms, please use [neko-rooms](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms).

**Supporting multiple platforms.**
* This project is focused on a specific set of platforms and does not aim to support all possible platforms.
* Only Linux is officially supported.
* If you want to run neko on a different platform, you are welcome to try, but we cannot guarantee that it will work.

**Voice/Video chat integration.**
* For voice chat capabilities, consider using [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) or [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/).

**Screen sharing.**
* Currently is screen sharing not within the scope of this project, but it may be added in the future.
* Use [screego](https://github.com/screego/server) for screen sharing.

**Mobile support.**
* This project is not optimized for mobile devices. Best-effort support is provided, but it is not a priority.
